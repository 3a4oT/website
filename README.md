## Helping with Localization

Providing translations for Vapor helps make the framework more inclusive and welcoming to newcomers!

Adding new translations is simple - copy an existing translation file in [`/src/i18n`](./src/i18n) and fill in the new language's translation.

Make sure that language IDs follow the [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) specification.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, consult the [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
